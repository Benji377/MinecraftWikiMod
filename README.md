# MinecraftWikiMod
A Minecraft mod that gives additional info about blocks, entities, items and more!

### Download

1. Download the release that most suits to you. Its always a .jar file
2. Open the .minecraft folder, you can do so by pressing the 'R' and Windows-key at the same time and type into the dialog box '%AppData%'
3. Copy the downloaded .jar file into the mods folder
4. Download forge for the version of the Mod (Right now its 1.16.1)
5. Start the Minecraft launcher and select Forge from the versions options
6. Click play and enjoy your mod !

### Usage

The mod is basically a very simplidfied wikipedia for certain game mechanics. Every part of the game will eventually be in the mod, but for now, you will need to look at the release you just downloaded to see what you can and can't do with the mod.
For every part of the game there is a command for it.
For Example: `/potion`

If you type help after a command it will explain the command to you. For example `/potion help` will tell you what you how to use it.

### Contribution

As always this project is fully open-source. Everyone is allowed to fork it and add its own idea and _magic_. Please do remember what the project is about, its about integrating the Minecraft Wikipedia in Minecraft to help especially new players to understand what everything is.
Also don't forget to look in the Projects tab and see if you can do any of the things listed there first.

One thing which is not allowed is stealing. **Copying the project and republishing it is severily prohibited**. Its not like I am making money out of this, but I just find it unfair to steal others idea without even giving credit sometimes.

### Credits

- Special thanks to [TheGreyGhost](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost) which gave me a huge help by publishing his mods on Github which gave me the ispiration to build mine.
- Thanks to [Forge for giving me an API](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.16.x/) to work with, I have no idea how I would have it done it without it.
